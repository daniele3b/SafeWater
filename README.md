# SafeWater

## Introduction

The managament of water resources is an important task in particular where there is a **shortage of water**, often rain water is not used or it's used in an inefficient way. SafeWater is an IoT solution that allows to the water resources's manager to monitor the **fill level** of the water containers and their **temperature** to choose the best moment to use them.
SafeWater is thought to maximize the capacity of the water silos and to choose the best way of use for a particular water resource, to reach these purposes it uses 2 kind of sensors:

- A DHT22: a sensor used to measure the temperature of the water;
- A Water level sensor: a sensor used to measure the fill level of the silos;

The system uses a relay in order to activate a water pump when the reserve is fill in order to use the water collected, and it use a servo motor in order to open and to close the water resource making it possible to collect water without waste.
