# SafeWater

The managament of water resources is an important task which helps to improve the environment quality. SafeWater is an IoT solution that allows to the water resources's manager to monitor the fill level of the water resources and their temperature to choose the best moment to use them.
SafeWater is thought to maximize the capacity of the water silos and to choose the best way of use for a particular water resource, to reach these purposes it uses 2 kind of sensors:

- A DHT22: a sensor used to measure the temperature of the water;
- A Water level: a sensor used to measure the fill level of the silos;

The system uses a relay in order to activate a water pump when the reserve is fill in order to use the water collected, and it use a servo motor in order to open and to close the water resource making it possible to collect water without waste.
