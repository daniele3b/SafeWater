# Evalution of the performance

## Setup the monitoring profile

In order to monitor devices we need to create a **monitoring profile**, it can be created from the GUI. The profile used for my experiments is posted below. You can find detailed info about monitoring at this [link](https://iot-lab.github.io/docs/tools/consumption-monitoring/).

As it is possible to see from the image above, I monitored the following metrics for each device:

- Power consumption (W);
- Current (A);
- Voltage (V);

In term of radio performance, I monitored the following metrics for each devices and in particular for the border router node:

- RSSI

I measured the performance of 2 channels: 11 and 14.
